"""Components required to run models on SpiNNaker.

The intent is that these components have nothing to do with Nengo at all and
are merely used to provide functionality above and beyond that provided by the
standard set of PACMAN tools.  In some cases (output_generator and regions) the
functionality replaces alternative solutions to the same problem.
